# sSMLM-protocol

Spectroscopic Single Molecule Localization Microscopy (sSMLM) is a method to measure the emission spectra of single molecules with nanometer precision. This repository contains the protocol for sSMLM measurements using a home-built setup. 
<!-- The protocol is described in detail in the following publication: -->

# Prerequisites
