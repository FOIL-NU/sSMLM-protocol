# sSMLM-protocol

Spectroscopic Single Molecule Localization Microscopy (sSMLM) extends traditional single molecule localization microscopy (SMLM) by adding a spectroscopic dimension to the localization process. This allows for the identification of different fluorophores based on their emission spectra, enabling multiplexed imaging of multiple targets in a single sample. This repository contains the accompanying software for processing sSMLM images captured with the DWP system, described in Song et al. 2022.

<!-- The protocol is described in detail in the following publication: -->

# Prerequisites
The accompanying software, `RainbowSTORM v2` requires at least MATLAB R2020b to run, and requires the following toolboxes:
- Curve Fitting Toolbox
- Statistics and Machine Learning Toolbox
- Text Analytics Toolbox
- Signal Processing Toolbox

The recommended MATLAB version is R2023b for the best compatibility with the software.
